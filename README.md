Welcome to Unicode-Shortcuts!!

"\heart" -> 💓  
"\questionman" -> 🧐  
"\nabla" -> ∇  
"\nerd" -> 🤓  
"\moneysmiles" -> 🤑  
and many more fun character mappings.

Building-

To build this project on a 64-bit machine with Windows 10,
1. Ensure msbuild is installed, available with the Windows SDK.
2. Clone this repository: "git clone https://github.com/benwu25/Unicode-Shortcuts"
3. Execute the command "msbuild Unicode-Shortcuts\Unicode-Shortcuts.sln"
4. To run the program, the executable is stored in "Unicode-Shortcuts\x64\Debug"

Notes:
Currently, it is only possible to hard-code string -> Unicode mappings in the source file  
Unicode-Shortcuts.cpp. I am hoping to add a feature allowing new mappings to be added and stored in the Window.
